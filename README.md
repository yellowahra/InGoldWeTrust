Fixed the looking of item names in the controllers using JSoup. Added the rs2xml jar again due to needing it to fill the table. Added image icon. Next: Adding item information on the Search.

I made it so the rs2xml jar is not needed anymore, and all items are up to date based of the wowhead website.

Make sure to add this jar file to the library while working on the program:

That allows us to read the XML file for item ID -> item name conversion
